	* vbs.g (CALL): store the last token so it is not overwritten by the IDENTIFIER 
	If a Call statement was inside a with statement, the expression "call .someMethod" would fail
	to parse.
	(COMMENT): Comments can end with the token %> 

	* vbs.act: lastType is now set by the overriden method makeToken of CharScaner.

	* vbs.g: Added support for the preserve keyword in the redim statement
	Changed the rule s_decl so it can accept any arithmetic expression as a subscript.
	Before: a(12, 13)
	Now: a(12, 39 + 1)
	(COMMENT): The token type of the comment depends on the last token's type.
	If the last token type is STATEMENT_END then it will be SKIP.
	This will eliminate to Tokens of type STATEMENT_END in a row.
